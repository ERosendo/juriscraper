<p>Defendant:</p>
<p>Edwin G. Almeyda</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>Petitioner Edwin Almeyda seeks an order to show cause why his sentences in two Fremont County cases should not be declared fully served.&nbsp; Almeyda was convicted in 1988 in three separate matters -- two in Fremont County and one in El Paso County. &nbsp;Pursuant to section 17-22.5-101, C.R.S., the DOC construed the sentences as one continuous 31 year sentence.&nbsp; In March 2001, he was granted parole, and in March 2003 parole was revoked.&nbsp; Almeyda argues, and the El Paso District Court found, that he could not be reincarcerated for more than 5 years, and that he has served his sentences in full.</p>
<p>On September 30, 2009, the supreme court issued a rule to show cause why the requested relief should not be granted.&nbsp; Respondent Mary Carlson, Director of CDOC Time and Release Operations, is directed to provide a written answer on or before October 30, 2009 why the requested relief should not be granted.&nbsp; Almeyda has 30 days from receipt of the answer within which to reply.</p>
<p>On January 11, 2010, the supreme court issued an order making the rule absolute; ordering the Director of the Department of Corrections CDOC Time and Release Operations to correct her records&nbsp;to indicate that all of the sentences&nbsp;are considered fully served and discharged&nbsp;and to notify all state, local agencies and officials.</p>

<p>Petitioner Robert Keith Ray seeks issuance of a stay in this death penalty case until the court rules in <em>People v. Sir Mario Owens</em>, 08SA402, and an order instructing the district court to allow the time permitted by Crim. P. 32.2 to file any post-trial motions.&nbsp; Specifically, he requests that imposition of a death sentence, which triggers the&nbsp;statutory non-extendable two year deadline for completing all postconviction and appellate litigation&nbsp;pursuant to section 16-12-208, C.R.S.,&nbsp;should be stayed here until the court determines in the <em>Owens</em> matter whether the &quot;no extension&quot; provision of the two-year deadline is constitutional.&nbsp; He also requests the supreme court to determine whether Judge Rafferty's ruling in the <em>Owens</em> case that the &quot;no&nbsp;extensions&quot; provision of the Unitary Review System is unconstitutional comepls him to formally enter the same ruling in his matter.&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp;he asks the supreme court&nbsp;to determine whether the district court exceeded its jurisdiction when it made motions for new trial due two weeks prior to sentencing even though Crim P. 32.2 provides that the defendant may file&nbsp;such motions no later than 15 days after the imposition of a sentence.</p>
<p>On September 30, 2009, the supreme court issued an order to show cause why the requested relief shold not be granted.&nbsp; Respondent The Honorable Gerald J. Rafferty and the People of the State of Colorado are directed to provide a written answer on or before October 30, 2009.&nbsp; Petitioner Ray has 30 days from receipt of the answer within which to reply.</p>

                    <p>District Court, Douglas County, 07CR675 (Judge Paul A. King)</p>
<p>Plaintiff:</p>
<p>The People of the State of Colorado,</p>
<p>v.</p>
<p>Defendant:</p>
<p>Carl Daniel Ruch.</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Petitioner Carl Ruch seeks relief from the district court's order remanding him to custody following his conviction on a class five felony stalking violation until such time as Mr. Ruch agrees to sign a waiver of confidentiality that the probation department requires in order to complete its presentence investigation.&nbsp; Mr. Ruch contends that the order forces him to waive his federal privacy rights and is unlawful because it is not reasonably&nbsp; necessary to accomplish preparation of the presentence report of a psychosexual evaluation, and is not otherwise supported by law.&nbsp; He requests that the order remanding him to the custody of the sheriff's department be vacated, and that the court order his release and reinstate his bond pending resolution of the action.</p>
<p>On January 29, 2009, the court issued a rule to show cause why the requested relief should not be granted.&nbsp; Respondents, the Honroable Paul King, the Arapahoe County District Attorney's Office, and the 18th Judicial District Probation Department, are directed to provide a written answe ron or before February 12, 2009 why the requested relief should not be granted.&nbsp; Petitioner Ruch has ten days from receipt of the asnwer within which to reply.&nbsp; The court further reversed the order remanding Ruch to the custody of the sheriff's department, and directed that upon consent of surety the previous bond shall be reinstated with all prior conditions imposed, at which time the sheriff's department shall release petitioner.&nbsp; The court ordered that the mandatory protection order pursuant to 18-1-1001, C.R.S., remains in effect.</p>
<p>On June 25, 2009, the supreme court issued an order making the rule absolute&nbsp;and the order of the district court remanding the defendant to the custody of the sheriff without bond be&nbsp;vacated for the reason that a refusal to sign a waiver&nbsp;of rights under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 1996 (HIPPA)&nbsp;is not a lawful&nbsp;ground for discontinuing bail after a person is convicted, pending sentencing or appeal. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Jennifer Keltner</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Petitioner Michelle Berry seeks relief from the trial court's order denying her motion for leave to endorse her treating physician as an expert witness in this personal injury case.&nbsp; berry contends that it was an abuse of discretion for the court to prohibit her from endorsing, as an expert witness, a treating physician who began treating her after the expert disclosure deadline, and who therefore was endorsed after the expert disclosure deadline, but before the discovery cut-off date.</p>

<p>On May 26, 2009, the court issued an opinion making the rule absolute.&nbsp; The Opinion can be found at: <a href="/Courts/Supreme_Court/opinions/2009/09SA5.pdf">http://www.courts.state.co.us/Courts/Supreme_Court/opinions/2009/09SA5.pdf</a></p>
